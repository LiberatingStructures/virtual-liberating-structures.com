# virtual-liberating-structures.com

This repository contains simple html code which presents an iframe allowing embedding of various google docs which make up the "Virtual Liberating Structures Community Handbook".

The source materials for the handbook are in the global public LS google drive folder.

The website is hosted using github pages.

The virtual-liberating-structures.com domain has been registered by David Heath on behalf of the global LS community. 

I intend for this to be a community owned and operated asset so if there is a better way to manage this I'm very happy to chat about it.

## Contributing

If you'd like to help improve the Virtual LS community handbook, you can do so in one of two ways:

1. firstly the handbook content itself is hosted in publicly editable google docs, and the global community of LS practitioners is invited to contribute, edit and improve those docs
2. if you would like to improve the iframe used to embed these pages, feel free to raise a pull request against this repo
